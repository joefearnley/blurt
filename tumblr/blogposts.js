        "body": "<p>Recently while keeping my mind alive in my free time, I took a PHP project I created last year and decided to add tests around it. Basically I wanted to test an HTTP API confirming that POST and GET requests were working and that data was being inserted into and retrieved from a database. I’ve very much an amateur when it comes to this kind of thing (thus why I am doing in first place) so I had to do some research. </p>\n\n<p>One of the first things I need to set up was the test data. Granted I could of just used the API to do the testing and confirm the results but I wanted to test each alone (this is where the unit part comes in). One way to do this would be to create a test database and the scripts to insert data to test and delete it once the test is over. Another option would be to use mock objects but since there weren’t really any classes involved with this app I couldn’t really figure out a good way to do that. </p>\n\n<p>This is where <a href=\"http://redbeanphp.com/\">RedBean</a> came in. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redbean_(software)\">Their wikipedia entry</a> does a good job of explaining what it can do. I started using this for the database abstraction stuff in the API code and it turns out it can do much more. Not only can you interact with the data with it but you can create tables, even databases right on the fly. Then you can also delete them on the fly. </p>\n\n<p>The following example creates a table named message. This is all my application uses so this is another reason why it worked so well in this situation. The one thing you have to make sure is that this table does not exist prior to this so you have to create a property for each column. Otherwise you’ll get an error trying to insert into data into a column that doesn’t exist. This forced me to change a couple of things in my code. Also, this will insert an extra record for the test data, so you will have to either delete at the beginning of each test or ignore it. </p>\n\n<pre>\n$message = RedBean_Facade::dispense('message');\n$message-&gt;app_name = 'application name';\n$message-&gt;body = 'message body';\n$message-&gt;type = 'message type';\n$message-&gt;posted = RedBean_Facade::$f-&gt;now();\nRedBean_Facade::store($message);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Then once you are done with the data, you can delete it.

        "body": "<p>2012, like any year, didn&rsquo;t disappoint in the music department. I was contemplating making one of these lists this year. I guess the main reason I am doing it is more a to create a list of what I listened to this year and suggest you check them out if you haven&rsquo;t already. I did listened to more music than this over the course of the year, but these ones stood out. So without further ado, here are my favorite records of 2012.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Snips: <i>Highs of Low</i></b> - I&rsquo;d only heard of The Snips prior to listening to this record. I heard a song on a podcast in the spring and went to check it out. Turns out the record is <a href=\"http://thesnips.com/\">free to download off their website</a> so began listening right away. I instantly became a fan. The sounds are very melodic and I love the singers voice. I ended up revisiting it many times throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Holy Mess: <i>Cande Ru Las Degas</i></b> - I knew these guys were recording at some point and was anticipating this release. It didn&rsquo;t disappoint at all and is probably my favorite form the list. Good old gruff punk from Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><b>Propagandhi: <i>Failed States</i></b> - These guys keep taking each record to the next level. I know I am probably in the minority but I liked their last record (<i>Supporting Caste</i>) better. Some of the song&rsquo;s lyrics are somewhere I can&rsquo;t get to and don&rsquo;t really want to. With that being said I think musically they hit it out of the park with this one.</p>\n\n<p><b>Menzingers: <i>On the Impossible Past</i></b> - I loved their last record and this one was a bit more polished. The songs were a little slower and it took me a bunch of spins for it to click but it finally did. The final product is, to me, timeless.</p>\n\n<p><b>No trigger: <i>Tycoon</i></b> - If you read my blog you know I&rsquo;ve not only been anticipating this record but hyping it as well. Even though they haven&rsquo;t put out a record in like 7 years it&rsquo;s as if they never missed a beat. Which make me think how ahead of it&rsquo;s time Canyoneer was. Every song on this record is great. </p>\n\n<p><b>Bruce Springsteen: <i>Wrecking Ball</i></b> - What can I say? I&rsquo;m a big fan of The Boss but haven&rsquo;t been blown away by anything he&rsquo;s put out in the last 10 years. This record was an exception. The song Wrecking Ball is one of those that I think could live on forever.</p>\n\n<p><b>Teeange Bottlerocket: Freak Out!</b> - I don&rsquo;t know why it took me so long to get into this band. Granted the super poppy punk has been done a million times but these guys nail it. Even the jokier songs are good. If there is one band I want to see live in 2013 it&rsquo;s these guys.</p>\n\n<p><b>Daytrader: <i>12 Years</i></b> - This was kind of a guilty pleasure. Even though I kind of dug the E.P. they put out last year I saw them play a show and was unimpressed . This full length was a great next step for the band. It has some super catchy songs on it. It&rsquo;s too bad they broke up before the year was over.</p>\n\n<p><b>Anchors: <i>Lost at the Bottom of the World</i></b> - Another solid release from a band that I don&rsquo;t think gets much love from the media. I had no idea this record was out until near the end of the year. Every song is solid. It&rsquo;s just good, catchy, fast punk that seems to be missing these days.</p>\n\n<p><b>NOFX: <i>Self-Entitled</i></b> - To me, NOFX hasn&rsquo;t released anything groundbreaking in the last 15 years but I do own and really like everything they&rsquo;ve done. This record was great. It was was simple with no joke songs. You can hear many Bad Religion influences throughout it. It had a rawness to it as well that created a refreshing, back-to-basics sound.</p>",

I guess the main reason I am doing it is more a to create a list of what I listened to this year and suggest you check them out if you haven’t already. I did listened to more music than this over the course of the year, but these ones stood out. So without further ado, here are my favorite records of 2012.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Snips: <i>Highs of Low</i></b> - I’d only heard of The Snips prior to listening to this record. I heard a song on a podcast in the spring and went to check it out. Turns out the record is <a href=\"http://thesnips.com/\">free to download off their website</a> so began listening right away. I instantly became a fan. The sounds are very melodic and I love the singers voice. I ended up revisiting it many times throughout the year.</p>\n\n<p><b>The Holy Mess: <i>Cande Ru Las Degas</i></b> - I knew these guys were recording at some point and was anticipating this release. It didn’t disappoint at all and is probably my favorite form the list. Good old gruff punk from Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p><b>Propagandhi: <i>Failed States</i></b> - These guys keep taking each record to the next level. I know I am probably in the minority but I liked their last record (<i>Supporting Caste</i>) better. Some of the song’s lyrics are somewhere I can’t get to and don’t really want to. With that being said I think musically they hit it out of the park with this one.</p>\n\n<p><b>Menzingers: <i>On the Impossible Past</i></b> - I loved their last record and this one was a bit more polished. The songs were a little slower and it took me a bunch of spins for it to click but it finally did. The final product is, to me, timeless.</p>\n\n<p><b>No trigger: <i>Tycoon</i></b> - If you read my blog you know I’ve not only been anticipating this record but hyping it as well. Even though they haven’t put out a record in like 7 years it’s as if they never missed a beat. Which make me think how ahead of it’s time Canyoneer was. Every song on this record is great. </p>\n\n<p><b>Bruce Springsteen: <i>Wrecking Ball</i></b> - What can I say? I’m a big fan of The Boss but haven’t been blown away by anything he’s put out in the last 10 years. This record was an exception. The song Wrecking Ball is one of those that I think could live on forever.</p>\n\n<p><b>Teeange Bottlerocket: Freak Out!</b> - I don’t know why it took me so long to get into this band. Granted the super poppy punk has been done a million times but these guys nail it. Even the jokier songs are good. If there is one band I want to see live in 2013 it’s these guys.</p>\n\n<p><b>Daytrader: <i>12 Years</i></b> - This was kind of a guilty pleasure. Even though I kind of dug the E.P. they put out last year I saw them play a show and was unimpressed . This full length was a great next step for the band. It has some super catchy songs on it. It’s too bad they broke up before the year was over.</p>\n\n<p><b>Anchors: <i>Lost at the Bottom of the World</i></b> - Another solid release from a band that I don’t think gets much love from the media. I had no idea this record was out until near the end of the year. Every song is solid. It’s just good, catchy, fast punk that seems to be missing these days.</p>\n\n<p><b>NOFX: <i>Self-Entitled</i></b> - To me, NOFX hasn’t released anything groundbreaking in the last 15 years but I do own and really like everything they’ve done. This record was great. It was was simple with no joke songs. You can hear many Bad Religion influences throughout it. It had a rawness to it as well that created a refreshing, back-to-basics sound.</p>",

What a blast that was.</li>\n<li>Later in July we took a cabin run to Bear Lake for the first time in a couple of years.

It&rsquo;s been a fun couple of years.</li>\n<li>I also bought a MacBook Air in December. It was long overdue and I love it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not to go unnoticed, I did write some code over the year. Here&rsquo;s a list of projects I created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joefearnley/joeno\">Joeno</a> - I finally attempted a node.js application.

This year with Protected Left done I think I am going to take a back seat to the music thing (at least for a few months) and focus on software development (that and of course raising my child). I want to get more involved with the local tech communities, write more code and contribute to an open source project. I also have a few trips in the making. I may finally get to see the west coast of this great nation!</p>\n\n<p>So heres to 2012. It&rsquo;s been real.</p>",

He ended up moving to Grand Rapids and I never heard back from him. I figured that was that.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to the fall of that year. I saw Mario at a Randy Thunderbird show at the Strutt. I asked how the band is going and he said Chad and him were still jamming but needed a bass player. I told him I had a bass guitar and amp in my basement at the moment and if he wanted to jam, let me know. A week later I saw him again at a Dead to Me show. He asked me if I was serious about playing the bass in his band. I said, I sure am. He then proceeded to pull out a stack of papers from his pocket. He handed me the stack and soon realized what it was. He had written the tablature of the bands seven songs. He told me to learn them and if I wanted they were jamming that Sunday. I learned the songs, jammed with them the next practice and the rest is history.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past two we&rsquo;ve recored <a href=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-doomed\">an EP</a>, <a href=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/album/posteritys-sake\">a full length</a> and <a href=\"http://protectedleft.org/shows\">played a boat-load of shows</a>. I&rsquo;ve met a bunch of new poeple and created some life long friends. Last week we released our full-length record and played our last show. Tonight we are taking the money have left over in the merch bin and going out for pizza and beers. <a href=\"http://protectedleft.org/post/37995773902/posteritys-sake-now-available\">Check out our record </a>when you have a moment. </p>",

Who am I kidding? I don&rsquo;t have a bucket list. If I did I am sure it would change every year.  Regardless, having a child would not be near the top&hellip;not even close. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) I married a woman who&rsquo;s number 1 (or maybe 2) goal in life was to be a mother (or maybe that is what it has felt like in the last couple of years). We decided near the beginning of the year to try and have a child. Well, not only did the conception happen faster than I thought it would, but the last 9 to 10 months have flown right by and after a week, here I am, still standing, trying to be a dad. </p>\n\n<p>If there is one thing I have take away from this last week it&rsquo;s that being a dad really isn&rsquo;t that hard. It&rsquo;s more about just getting in there and giving it your best.

I think putting your code out there for the public to see is a great idea. It&rsquo;s very similar to making art and putting it out there for the world to critique.

I&rsquo;d rather write straight HTML so I looked into something what kind of integration is out there for <a href=\"http://mustache.github.com/\">mustache</a> or <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a>. Turns out there is a Node package called <a href=\"https://github.com/donpark/hbs\">hbs</a> that allows you to integrate handlebars pretty seamlessly.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to integrate Handlebars with Express I&rsquo;d suggest checking <a href=\"https://github.com/donpark/hbs\">hbs</a> out specifically looking at the <a href=\"https://github.com/donpark/hbs/blob/master/test/server/app.js\">test application</a> the author created.</p>",

        "body": "<p>2011 was a fun year. I started it out with a trip to the Caribbean. I don&rsquo;t think that was the best way to start a year out but I was able to come back home with a clear mind. But, like every year, I didn&rsquo;t get half of what I wanted to get done. I&rsquo;ve learned over the past few years that new year&rsquo;s resolutions are really just a wish list. If you don&rsquo;t establish concrete goals nothing is going to get done.</p>\n<p>One thing I want to do more this year is play guitar. Not just play it, because I do enough of that but actually get better at it. Push myself a little more and learn some new things. The possibilities are endless with an instrument like this. I also want contribute to an open source project. I started to learn python this past year which was fun. But working with others code and being a part of something in the public space is a whole new level. There are just too many opportunities and too big of a community to not be a part of it.</p>\n<p>Looking back on the year, here is a list of some of the highlights:</p>\n<ul><li>In February Protected Left entered the Cold War Studios and recorded <a href=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/\">an E.P</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://clydesdalescale.com/\" title=\"http://clydesdalescale.com/\">The Clydesdale Scale</a> played our first show. It was also the first show I have played since the early 2000&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>In April I launched <a href=\"http://joeymarinara.com/\" title=\"Joey Marinara\">Joey Marinara</a>. I&rsquo;ve had this idea for a couple years and I&rsquo;ve found it a lot of fun to do. So there is one thing I got done on my todos for 2011.</li>\n<li>Summer hockey was a blast. I recruited Jason, Craig and TJ for the season. We would get tuned up before the games and ended up winning the league championship which resulted in me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/6043850178/in/photostream\" title=\"The Cup\">earning a cup</a>. Come the fall I finally feel like my game is starting to come together.</li>\n<li>Starting in april Protected Left played a handful of shows throughout the spring an summer. Cities included Kalamazoo, Lansing, Indianapolis, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Akron and Detroit. I was able to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157628809261535/\">take some pictures</a> of the journey.</li>\n<li>In October, me and a bunch of my pals took at trip to Chicago to see NOFX at the House of Blues. Man what a fun weekend.</li>\n<li>In November Rachel and I took a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157628299178267/\">trip to Pittsburgh</a>. We are both big fans of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture so we visited two of his homes in the area. We also went to a Penguins game which was my first official NHL game that I was in stands for. </li>\n<li>December was a busy month. Not only was Christmas going down at the end but Jason got married on the third weekend so not only did I have to work in a wedding one of the weekends but a bachelor party as well. It was my first time to the Joe Louis Arena and a Red Wings game. Another really fun weekend with my friends. </li>\n<li>Finally at the end of the year, I took a new job. I am excited and a nervous. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</li>\n</ul><p>As far as music is concerned here is what I was (and still am) listening to in 2011:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mute</strong> - <em><strong>Thunderblast</strong></em> - Man did this album rips. I saw these guys open up for Strung Out last year and didn&rsquo;t really seek them out. On a whim I looked up the band to see what they were up to saw they put this record out. What a great decision. </li>\n<li><strong>Banner Pilot </strong>- <em><strong>Heart Beats Pacific</strong></em> - So pop-punk is alive and well. I kind of got my fill of it many years ago and haven&rsquo;t really been in to the genre that much. This record though, changed it for me. So catchy, so good.</li>\n<li><strong>Heartsounds</strong> - <strong><em>Drifter</em> - </strong>After first hearing Heartsounds, I could tell the band had something. To me though, their first record was missing something. <em>Drifter </em>changed that for me. This sort of skate-punk genre was in full effect this year and this record added to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Red City Radio</strong> - <em><strong>The Dangers of Standing Still - </strong></em>Ever couple of years a band with that Hot Water Music sound comes along that changes thing a little bit. There a not a bad song on this record. I actually got a chance to play a show with these guys and their live show sounds just as good. I think it&rsquo;s going to hard for them to top this one.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fucking Cops - </strong><em><strong>Fuck You Up With Some Truth - </strong></em>I got to play in Cleveland in the spring. The punk scene there is alive and well. This record in one of the best to come out of that scene as far as I am concerned. It&rsquo;s a little on the &ldquo;low-fi&rdquo; side but I think that&rsquo;s what gives it a little character.</li>\n<li><em><strong>T</strong></em><strong>his is a Standoff</strong> - <strong><em>Be Delighted - </em></strong>Speaking of skate-punk, I can&rsquo;t believe it took me this long to get into this band. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, some of these guys used to be in the band Belvedere and basically picked up where that band left off.  This E.P. rules and I hope for a full-length this year and a tour.</li>\n<li><strong>Rain Over Battle</strong> - <strong><em>These Rocks In Our Bodies</em></strong> - I heard a song off this record while listening to the Punknews Podcast. That particular song reminded me a lot of The Riot Before. I ended up downloading the record and could not stop listening to it. I have high hopes for these young dudes.</li>\n<li><strong>Banquets</strong> - <strong><em>Top Button, Bottom Shelf - </em></strong>I loved the E.P. these guys put out last year and this full-length is even better. Just good, catchy rock music. It reminds me a lot of <em>Meet Me at the Bottom</em> which is a good thing.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchors</strong> - <em><strong>Bad Juju</strong></em> - This record got a little buzz on punknews so I decided to check it out. A great decision it was. It&rsquo;s a great mixture of punk with a tiny bit of hardcore thrown in. </li>\n<li><strong>The Holy Mess</strong> - <em><strong>The Holy Mess</strong></em> - I loved the E.P. these guys put out a couple of years ago. This record contained all of those songs plus several more. The new songs also ruled. I got to see these guys open up for The Lawrence Arms and Naked Raygun this year. They put on a hell of a show.</li>\n</ul><p>Honorable Mention</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Chuck Ragan</strong> - <em><strong>Covering Ground</strong></em> - So far nothing Chuck has put out has matched up to Feast or Famine. This record was probably the closest. Good, but should have been better.</li>\n<li><strong>Dead to Me</strong> - <strong><em>Moscow Penny Ante</em></strong> - I had high hopes for this record but just can&rsquo;t get into it. I know they made a new transition with member changes but it didn&rsquo;t do it for me.</li>\n<li><strong>Dave Hause - <em>Resolutions</em> - </strong>I&rsquo;m a big fan of The Loved Ones so I was excited to hear what this record sounded like. Ultimately I really liked this record but I felt like something was missing. </li>\n<li><strong>Polar Bear Club - </strong><strong><em>Clash Battle Guilt Pride</em> - </strong>This was probably my least favorite record this band released. I really couldn&rsquo;t get into the first several listens but then it started to click. Even though it sort of eventually won me over I was hoping for something better.</li>\n<li><strong>Face to Face - </strong><em><strong>Laugh Now, Laugh Later </strong>- </em>Going into listening to this record, I really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. I&rsquo;ve never been a huge Face to Face fan but this record was damn good. It made me feel like it was 1997 all over again.</li>\n</ul><p>Unfortunately there is just too much music out there these days. I usually go in cycles of two weeks at a time if a record is good. It kind of limits things for me. But I have to remind myself that it&rsquo;s something I can always go back to.</p>\n<p>I also ended up attending quite a few shows this year and started to make a list of them. Here is a list of bands I saw play in 2011 (give or take a few):</p>\n<ul><li>The Lawrence Arms</li>\n<li>The Holy Mess</li>\n<li>Mustard Plug</li>\n<li>Flatfoot 56</li>\n<li>We Are the Union</li>\n<li>Naked Raygun</li>\n<li>Flatliners</li>\n<li>Chuck Ragan</li>\n<li>SHARKS</li>\n<li>Red City Radio</li>\n<li>Mixtapes</li>\n<li>Against Me!</li>\n<li>Screaming Females</li>\n<li>Daytrader</li>\n<li>Fake Problems</li>\n<li>The Swellers</li>\n<li>RIVIR</li>\n<li>NOFX</li>\n<li>Anti Flag</li>\n<li>Old Man Markley</li>\n<li>Every Time I Die</li>\n<li>GWAR</li>\n</ul><p>I am looking forward to 2012. I have a lot to do and little time. Things have already start to gear up and I am totally stoked for the new year.</p>",

I have high hopes for these young dudes.</li>\n<li><strong>Banquets</strong> - <strong><em>Top Button, Bottom Shelf - </em></strong>I loved the E.P. these guys put out last year and this full-length is even better. Just good, catchy rock music. It reminds me a lot of <em>Meet Me at the Bottom</em> which is a good thing.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchors</strong> - <em><strong>Bad Juju</strong></em> - This record got a little buzz on punknews so I decided to check it out. A great decision it was. It’s a great mixture of punk with a tiny bit of hardcore thrown in. </li>\n<li><strong>The Holy Mess</strong> - <em><strong>The Holy Mess</strong></em> - I loved the E.P. these guys put out a couple of years ago. This record contained all of those songs plus several more. The new songs also ruled. I got to see these guys open up for The Lawrence Arms and Naked Raygun this year. They put on a hell of a show.</li>\n</ul><p>Honorable Mention</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Chuck Ragan</strong> - <em><strong>Covering Ground</strong></em> - So far nothing Chuck has put out has matched up to Feast or Famine. This record was probably the closest. Good, but should have been better.</li>\n<li><strong>Dead to Me</strong> - <strong><em>Moscow Penny Ante</em></strong> - I had high hopes for this record but just can’t get into it. I know they made a new transition with member changes but it didn’t do it for me.</li>\n<li><strong>Dave Hause - <em>Resolutions</em> - </strong>I’m a big fan of The Loved Ones so I was excited to hear what this record sounded like. Ultimately I really liked this record but I felt like something was missing. </li>\n<li><strong>Polar Bear Club - </strong><strong><em>Clash Battle Guilt Pride</em> - </strong>This was probably my least favorite record this band released. I really couldn’t get into the first several listens but then it started to click. Even though it sort of eventually won me over I was hoping for something better.</li>\n<li><strong>Face to Face - </strong><em><strong>Laugh Now, Laugh Later </strong>- </em>Going into listening to this record, I really didn’t know what to expect. I’ve never been a huge Face to Face fan but this record was damn good. It made me feel like it was 1997 all over again.</li>\n</ul><p>Unfortunately there is just too much music out there these days. I usually go in cycles of two weeks at a time if a record is good. It kind of limits things for me. But I have to remind myself that it’s something I can always go back to.</p>\n<p>I also ended up attending quite a few shows this year and started to make a list of them. Here is a list of bands I saw play in 2011 (give or take a few):</p>\n<ul><li>The Lawrence Arms</li>\n<li>The Holy Mess</li>\n<li>Mustard Plug</li>\n<li>Flatfoot 56</li>\n<li>We Are the Union</li>\n<li>Naked Raygun</li>\n<li>Flatliners</li>\n<li>Chuck Ragan</li>\n<li>SHARKS</li>\n<li>Red City Radio</li>\n<li>Mixtapes</li>\n<li>Against Me!</li>\n<li>Screaming Females</li>\n<li>Daytrader</li>\n<li>Fake Problems</li>\n<li>The Swellers</li>\n<li>RIVIR</li>\n<li>NOFX</li>\n<li>Anti Flag</li>\n<li>Old Man Markley</li>\n<li>Every Time I Die</li>\n<li>GWAR</li>\n</ul><p>I am looking forward to 2012.

I don’t think that was the best way to start a year out but I was able to come back home with a clear mind. But, like every year, I didn’t get half of what I wanted to get done. I’ve learned over the past few years that new year’s resolutions are really just a wish list. If you don’t establish concrete goals nothing is going to get done.</p>\n<p>One thing I want to do more this year is play guitar. Not just play it, because I do enough of that but actually get better at it. Push myself a little more and learn some new things. The possibilities are endless with an instrument like this. I also want contribute to an open source project. I started to learn python this past year which was fun. But working with others code and being a part of something in the public space is a whole new level. There are just too many opportunities and too big of a community to not be a part of it.</p>\n<p>Looking back on the year, here is a list of some of the highlights:</p>\n<ul><li>In February Protected Left entered the Cold War Studios and recorded <a href=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"http://protectedleft.bandcamp.com/\">an E.P</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://clydesdalescale.com/\" title=\"http://clydesdalescale.com/\">The Clydesdale Scale</a> played our first show. It was also the first show I have played since the early 2000’s.</li>\n<li>In April I launched <a href=\"http://joeymarinara.com/\" title=\"Joey Marinara\">Joey Marinara</a>. I’ve had this idea for a couple years and I’ve found it a lot of fun to do. So there is one thing I got done on my todos for 2011.</li>\n<li>Summer hockey was a blast. I recruited Jason, Craig and TJ for the season. We would get tuned up before the games and ended up winning the league championship which resulted in me <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/6043850178/in/photostream\" title=\"The Cup\">earning a cup</a>. Come the fall I finally feel like my game is starting to come together.</li>\n<li>Starting in april Protected Left played a handful of shows throughout the spring an summer. Cities included Kalamazoo, Lansing, Indianapolis, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Akron and Detroit. I was able to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157628809261535/\">take some pictures</a> of the journey.</li>\n<li>In October, me and a bunch of my pals took at trip to Chicago to see NOFX at the House of Blues. Man what a fun weekend.</li>\n<li>In November Rachel and I took a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157628299178267/\">trip to Pittsburgh</a>. We are both big fans of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture so we visited two of his homes in the area. We also went to a Penguins game which was my first official NHL game that I was in stands for. </li>\n<li>December was a busy month. Not only was Christmas going down at the end but Jason got married on the third weekend so not only did I have to work in a wedding one of the weekends but a bachelor party as well. It was my first time to the Joe Louis Arena and a Red Wings game. Another really fun weekend with my friends. </li>\n<li>Finally at the end of the year, I took a new job. I am excited and a nervous. We’ll see how it goes.</li>\n</ul><p>As far as music is concerned here is what I was (and still am) listening to in 2011:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Mute</strong> - <em><strong>Thunderblast</strong></em> - Man did this album rips. I saw these guys open up for Strung Out last year and didn’t really seek them out. On a whim I looked up the band to see what they were up to saw they put this record out. What a great decision. </li>\n<li><strong>Banner Pilot </strong>- <em><strong>Heart Beats Pacific</strong></em> - So pop-punk is alive and well. I kind of got my fill of it many years ago and haven’t really been in to the genre that much. This record though, changed it for me. So catchy, so good.</li>\n<li><strong>Heartsounds</strong> - <strong><em>Drifter</em> - </strong>After first hearing Heartsounds, I could tell the band had something. To me though, their first record was missing something. <em>Drifter </em>changed that for me. This sort of skate-punk genre was in full effect this year and this record added to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Red City Radio</strong> - <em><strong>The Dangers of Standing Still - </strong></em>Ever couple of years a band with that Hot Water Music sound comes along that changes thing a little bit. There a not a bad song on this record. I actually got a chance to play a show with these guys and their live show sounds just as good. I think it’s going to hard for them to top this one.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fucking Cops - </strong><em><strong>Fuck You Up With Some Truth - </strong></em>I got to play in Cleveland in the spring. The punk scene there is alive and well. This record in one of the best to come out of that scene as far as I am concerned. It’s a little on the “low-fi” side but I think that’s what gives it a little character.</li>\n<li><em><strong>T</strong></em><strong>his is a Standoff</strong> - <strong><em>Be Delighted - </em></strong>Speaking of skate-punk, I can’t believe it took me this long to get into this band. For those of you who don’t know, some of these guys used to be in the band Belvedere and basically picked up where that band left off.  This E.P. rules and I hope for a full-length this year and a tour.</li>\n<li><strong>Rain Over Battle</strong> - <strong><em>These Rocks In Our Bodies</em></strong> - I heard a song off this record while listening to the Punknews Podcast.

        "body": "<p>For a project at working on at my day job, I was required to utilize a form of data compression called Packed ASCII. In my case I was writing data as a string to <a href=\"http://www.hartcomm.org/\">HART</a> devices. Here is the formal definition:</p>\n\n<p><i>Packed ASCII is a HART-specific 6-bit character code representing a subset of the ASCII character code set.

It basically started out as a joke but after buying the domain name two years ago and a year after that actually starting to document things, I finally have a year&rsquo;s worth of entries posted. I don&rsquo;t really know if anything is going to happen with this blog but it&rsquo;s kind of fun to do and who knows maybe it will attract some attention. Maybe even score a pie from it!\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s abnormally cold for Michigan in mid to late April. It actually snowed two days in a row this past weekend. I remember when I graduated from college, that night we had a party and it snowed all night. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned all bets are off until May. </p>\n\n<p>It was also record store day last Saturday. It&rsquo;s kind of sad I actually have a record store a few blocks from my house that sells a bunch of vinyl and I&rsquo;ve only been there two times this year. I used to have a plan to build this massive vinyl collection a few years ago. I soon realized how bad of an idea that is. Not that I don&rsquo;t enjoy buying records (I can&rsquo;t leave one of these stores without at least a couple) but that fact that if I were to ever move I would probably end up giving away most of them anyway. Regardless, I scored three record for 5 bucks including this bad boy:</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/5625744820/\" title=\"My vote for worst record cover ever. #recoredstoreday by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5625744820_fb16c27d81.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"My vote for worst record cover ever. #recoredstoreday\"/></a></p>\n\n<p>What else has been going on in my life? Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve been keeping plenty busy playing music. I have band practice two times a week and both <a href=\"http://clydesdalescale.com/\">The Clydesdale Scale</a> and <a href=\"http://protectedleft.org\">Protected Left</a> have started playing shows. E.P.s for both band should be out soon. Vocals need to be finished for the Scale and mastering is in the works for PL. There is also a plan to do a mini tour next month. I&rsquo;ll have to document that process.</p>\n\n<p>As for hacking is concerned. I just re-upped my Blue Host hosting account for another three months. After that I plan to move to a cheaper solution. In the process I have been looking at ways to somewhat modify some of my simpler websites I have out there. I&rsquo;ve been playing around with things like Html5 and nodejs. So much to learn so little time.</p>\n\n<p>I did enter a contract with my gym. I&rsquo;m going to have to save that lack of progress for different entry.</p>",

One about the year in review and my hopes for the year to come and one about some of my favorite music of the year. This one&rsquo;s about music. So here goes, in no particular order, the jams I&rsquo;ve was rockin&rsquo; to in 2010:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>RVIVR</strong> - <strong><em>LP </em></strong><em>- </em>I dug The Shorebirds but I really feel like RVIVR is the sound that I was looking for when Latterman ended. And I&rsquo;m a sucker for a chick singer so that really put it over the top. They also released another E.P. before the year ended which was also very good.</li>\n<li><strong>Smoke or Fire </strong>-<strong> <em>The Speakeasy</em></strong> - I anticipated this record for the last couple of years. It was released on a day I had to rake leaves so i bought it to listen to while I do so and was instantly tuned in as soon as the first song started. It will always remind me of that smell of autumn.</li>\n<li><strong>The Riot Before </strong>- <strong>Rebellion </strong>&mdash; I first this band about three years ago after downloading an E.P. from Quote Unquote. This entire record is great. The last song is the most epic thing I&rsquo;ve heard in a while. </li>\n<li><strong>Iron Chic</strong> - <em><strong>Not Like This</strong></em> - I loved the demo these guys put out a couple years ago and have been waiting for a full length ever since. <em>Shitty Rambo</em> was OK in my book and I know there was more to this band. This record definitely showed that. </li>\n<li><strong>None More Black</strong> - <strong><em>Icons </em></strong>- This year was like 2005 all over again. I tought these guys were done for but they got back together and put out this monster of record. New drummer, same catchy, unique music. I just really hope they tour through the midwest this year.</li>\n<li><strong>GhostFace Killah</strong> - <em><strong>Apollo Kids</strong></em> - I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention to Ghostface (or hip-hop in general) in several years. I started to follow him on twitter earlier in the year and got to hear some of the songs early on. So I thought I would take a shot at this record and was presently surprised.  </li>\n<li><strong>Banquets</strong> - <em><strong>This is Our Concern, Dude</strong></em> - This was a short E.P. from the old singer of Let Me Run&rsquo;s new band. I can&rsquo;t pass up free music so I downloaded this record and it was great. The songs could easily been on Meet Me at the Bottom. I am excited to see what these guys do in 2011.</li>\n<li><strong>Coffee Project</strong> - <em><strong>Moved On</strong></em> - I got hooked on Coffee Project after hearing a couple of songs from a Paper + Plastic compilation released during 2009 some time. This dude writes some awesome tunes. Combined that with a trombone and its magic. </li>\n<li><strong>Brenden Kelly/Joe McMahon</strong> - <strong><em>Wasted Potential</em></strong> - I didn&rsquo;t actually listen to this record until I went on my cruise at the first of the year. Listening to this record while laying in the sun drinking a beer was damn near heaven, especially McMahon&rsquo;s side. I never thought the acoustic version of Smoke or Fire would be so awesome. I actually had never heard anything prior to Above this City from them and after listening to Beauty fades about fifty times over the week I had to seek out Worker&rsquo;s Union. </li>\n</ul><p>Honorable Mention</p>\n<ul><li><strong>No Trigger</strong> - <strong><em>Be Honest</em></strong> - I really beilieve canyoneer is one of the best records realeased in the 2000&rsquo;s so I have been anticipating something from these guys for a long time. It was only two songs though. I am REALLY looking forward to the full length this year.</li>\n<li><strong>Against Me!</strong> - <strong><em>White Crosses</em></strong> - I listened to this record a lot over easter weekend. But then I didn&rsquo;t really have the desire to go back to it. I was really good but for some reason very forgetful at the same time. </li>\n<li><strong>The Flatliners </strong>- <strong><em>Cavalcade</em></strong> - Everyone thought this record was so great. I don&rsquo;t know, for me, it left a lot to be desired. I thought The Great Awake was so much better. Maybe I should revisit it. </li>\n</ul>",

Life for me wasn&rsquo;t the best it could be. I was stressed out about school, was working a job a 12 year old could do, and my love life was in shambles.

The funny thing is none of the independent stores had it, we found it at a Circuit City of all places. Anyway, we picked up some forties, went home and played this thing all night. It was a Tuesday and we didn&rsquo;t have a care in the world. We called it the listening party. Just us two and some weird dude that randomly knocked on our back door looking for something that escapes me at the moment while our room mates came home wondering what the hell was going on. </p>\n\n<p>We got to see strung out play a month later.

        "title": "1994! and Big Kids at The Strutt",
        "body": "<p>Wednesday night I hit the Strutt to see a couple of bands that sparked my interest. A couple of local bands were playing as well as a couple from out of town. Unfortunately the show didn’t start until well after nine. But it’s summer time and we have to live for the nights. Or at least that’s what I got out of Grease.\n \nThe first band to play was Village and Oak. A friend of mine pointed out that the name wasn’t that clever. It’s all about location these days.

I hadn&rsquo;t taken this much time off of work in the last five years so I thought, what the hell, let&rsquo;s do it.\n\nSo friday started on a different note. I played in the Mona Shores Sailor Classic. Which is a golf outing for Mona Shores High, my almamater. I have a love hate relatoinship with this golf outing. I always see a lot of people I miss and enjoy being around as well as a bunch of people I could care less to. It was good though, we ended fourteen under. And Jeff got iced.\n\nSo the next day, Rachel and I headed north. Mackanaw to was the first stop. I had never been through the actual city. It was a neat little town. My favorite bar was The Admiral&rsquo;s Table. I got to paruse it a while Rachel hit the sack. I met a nice couple from the Detroit area. Oh, and I rode a tandem bike.\n\nThe next day were headed for the U.P. Our first stop was Tahquamenon Falls. Apparently it&rsquo;s one of the biggest waterfalls around. I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect. If there is one thing I have learned on this trip was I&rsquo;m not much of a woodmen. Here&rsquo;s a little bit of the action:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SKUQQH5Q50w&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SKUQQH5Q50w&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\n</div>\n\nNext we headed to Munising. It rained most of the drive which was fine because there is a whole lot of nothing in that area. And there really isn&rsquo;t much in once you get to the town. We ate at the <a href=\"http://www.dogpatchrestaurant.com/\">dogpatch</a> for some very subpar pizza and had more breakfast than I probably have in my life. We did take a <a href=\"http://www.picturedrocks.com/Home.php\">boat tour</a> though that takes you up the coast almost 40 miles and back. It sprinkled a tad at the very end, other than that the weather was good. The captain was unintentionally entertaining to me. I had a good impression of him down by the end of the trip. \n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/4829092966/\" title=\"Untitled by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4829092966_654f486a85.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\"/></a>\n</div>\n\nThe next mourning it was back to Muskegon. We debated stopping in Traverse City for the night but it didn&rsquo;t happen. At least I can knock this one off the bucket list.",

I hadn’t taken this much time off of work in the last five years so I thought, what the hell, let’s do it.\n\nSo friday started on a different note. I played in the Mona Shores Sailor Classic. Which is a golf outing for Mona Shores High, my almamater. I have a love hate relatoinship with this golf outing. I always see a lot of people I miss and enjoy being around as well as a bunch of people I could care less to. It was good though, we ended fourteen under. And Jeff got iced.\n\nSo the next day, Rachel and I headed north. Mackanaw to was the first stop. I had never been through the actual city. It was a neat little town. My favorite bar was The Admiral’s Table. I got to paruse it a while Rachel hit the sack. I met a nice couple from the Detroit area. Oh, and I rode a tandem bike.\n\nThe next day were headed for the U.P. Our first stop was Tahquamenon Falls. Apparently it’s one of the biggest waterfalls around. I didn’t really know what to expect. If there is one thing I have learned on this trip was I’m not much of a woodmen. Here’s a little bit of the action:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SKUQQH5Q50w&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/SKUQQH5Q50w&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"480\" height=\"385\"></embed></object>\n</div>\n\nNext we headed to Munising. It rained most of the drive which was fine because there is a whole lot of nothing in that area. And there really isn’t much in once you get to the town. We ate at the <a href=\"http://www.dogpatchrestaurant.com/\">dogpatch</a> for some very subpar pizza and had more breakfast than I probably have in my life. We did take a <a href=\"http://www.picturedrocks.com/Home.php\">boat tour</a> though that takes you up the coast almost 40 miles and back. It sprinkled a tad at the very end, other than that the weather was good. The captain was unintentionally entertaining to me. I had a good impression of him down by the end of the trip. \n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/4829092966/\" title=\"Untitled by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4829092966_654f486a85.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\"></a>\n</div>\n\nThe next mourning it was back to Muskegon.

Then in the early 2000s I listened to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_fall\">Shadows Fall</a> because I thought they were the second coming of shred. I eventually had an Iron Maiden CD in my car around this same time and I liked it. Something about British metal made me wonder what life as an estranged teenager in the early eighties was like. \n\nWell, given all the metal and it&rsquo;s exploitation in the mid to late eighties, I never liked Judas Priest. Yet that&rsquo;s not the point of this post. I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104140/\">this film</a> when looking up metal documentaries. I&rsquo;ve been listening to a podcast call <a href=\"http://guntrafficradio.podomatic.com/\">Raised by Wolves</a> (which is hosted by the singer of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughead%27s_Revenge\">Jugheads Revenge</a>, and if you&rsquo;re in eighties punk you should tototally listen to it) and they we&rsquo;re talking about <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/heavy-metal-parking-lot\">Heavy Metal Parking Lot</a>. And for those of you that have not seen this film, here is a glimpse:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<object width=\"512\" height=\"296\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.hulu.com/embed/8TD3oPfNJtMhczHHJvzxyA\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><embed src=\"http://www.hulu.com/embed/8TD3oPfNJtMhczHHJvzxyA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"512\" height=\"296\"></embed></object>\n</div>\n\nBack to my search on metal documentaries. There is one named Dream Deceivers and basically is about the story of two teenagers that make a suicide pact and both shoot each other in the head. But unfortunately for James Vance, he lives. It&rsquo;s a wild story that starts out with the one mother with the flowy hairdo that thinks heavy metal is the anti-christ (you know the type) that wants to blame the Judas Priest for her son taking his life (or attempting to). \n\nAs the film unfolds, you get a glimpse into two kids&rsquo; lives whose mothers not only neglects them and their signs of depression but who also have a father that believes misbehavior can be corrected by a few fists to the head. Another disturbing part is when they call the sister of one of teens to the witness stand to talk about her suicide attempts. And the whole time, James&rsquo; mother wants to blame music on the fact that she&rsquo;s a bad mother. The scene where the mother and father are sitting on the couch talking about previous counseling sessions shows why these children were troubled. But, in the end, the women finds a new life with God and James loses his. Go figure. \n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<embed id=\"VideoPlayback\" src=\"http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docid=8514529801031861200&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true\" style=\"width:400px;height:326px\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"> </embed>\n</div>\n\nThis film isn&rsquo;t just about how music can influence your life. It&rsquo;s so much more than that. I think this story should be a case study in child development research. I also think anyone thinking about having a child should watch it. Some problems can&rsquo;t be ignored, others can&rsquo;t be cause by heavy metal.\n\n<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8514529801031861200#\">Dream Deceivers on google video</a>",

Then in the early 2000s I listened to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_fall\">Shadows Fall</a> because I thought they were the second coming of shred. I eventually had an Iron Maiden CD in my car around this same time and I liked it. Something about British metal made me wonder what life as an estranged teenager in the early eighties was like. \n\nWell, given all the metal and it’s exploitation in the mid to late eighties, I never liked Judas Priest. Yet that’s not the point of this post. I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104140/\">this film</a> when looking up metal documentaries.

It’s a wild story that starts out with the one mother with the flowy hairdo that thinks heavy metal is the anti-christ (you know the type) that wants to blame the Judas Priest for her son taking his life (or attempting to). \n\nAs the film unfolds, you get a glimpse into two kids’ lives whose mothers not only neglects them and their signs of depression but who also have a father that believes misbehavior can be corrected by a few fists to the head. Another disturbing part is when they call the sister of one of teens to the witness stand to talk about her suicide attempts. And the whole time, James’ mother wants to blame music on the fact that she’s a bad mother. The scene where the mother and father are sitting on the couch talking about previous counseling sessions shows why these children were troubled.

The first choice from the mac community is <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>. Even xeeton suggested this with his own built in theme. I guess I am too much of a cheap ass to move ahead with it, but for some reason I refuse to pay for something like this. Same thing with <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/coda/\">coda</a>. Its no free and shit, I&rsquo;m jaded. </p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a> as my main editor at work, so I thought I would see if it had any potential with php. Turns out it does. But the fact that it&rsquo;s so bloated just makes everything annoying. Same deal with <a href=\"http://aptana.com/\">Aptana</a>. Which I was hooked on for a while, but after not using it for a couple of weeks, it updated itself and something broke. I guess it just wasn&rsquo;t worth it in the end. </p>\n\n<p>Then I started using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a> for a while. Besides <a href=\"http://www.emeraldeditor.com/\">Crimson Editor</a> on windows, I use <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">gVim and Vim</a> for all my basic editing needs. I also use Vim on server related stuff and have grown to love it. I gave MacVim a good go and even with plugins such as nerdTree, it still leaves a lot to be desired. </p>\n\n<p><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/4118122920/\" title=\"Gedit by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4118122920_e2124a5bec.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" alt=\"Gedit\"/></a></p>\n\n<p><br/>\nThen I found out that you can run <a href=\"http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/\">gedit</a> on OS X.

A match made in heaven!&rdquo; No so fast cowboy, some things don&rsquo;t quite work. Firstly, it doesn&rsquo;t restore my previous session when I close it. Maybe I should never close it. Haha! I guess that&rsquo;s one option (god, I find myself saying that a lot lately). Then the fact that the cursor breaks after saving a file sometimes and it doesn&rsquo;t have a terminal plugin drives me nuts. Especially when trying to develop on a 13&quot; screen. </p>\n\n<p>My conclusion is I will, for now, stick with gedit. At least until the first phase of this app is done. My trial expired with TextMate and  Aptana pissed me off. Maybe the new version is better? Stay tuned.</p>",

The first choice from the mac community is <a href=\"http://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a>. Even xeeton suggested this with his own built in theme. I guess I am too much of a cheap ass to move ahead with it, but for some reason I refuse to pay for something like this. Same thing with <a href=\"http://www.panic.com/coda/\">coda</a>. Its no free and shit, I’m jaded. </p>\n\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a> as my main editor at work, so I thought I would see if it had any potential with php. Turns out it does. But the fact that it’s so bloated just makes everything annoying. Same deal with <a href=\"http://aptana.com/\">Aptana</a>. Which I was hooked on for a while, but after not using it for a couple of weeks, it updated itself and something broke. I guess it just wasn’t worth it in the end. </p>\n\n<p>Then I started using <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/macvim/\">MacVim</a> for a while. Besides <a href=\"http://www.emeraldeditor.com/\">Crimson Editor</a> on windows, I use <a href=\"http://www.vim.org/\">gVim and Vim</a> for all my basic editing needs. I also use Vim on server related stuff and have grown to love it. I gave MacVim a good go and even with plugins such as nerdTree, it still leaves a lot to be desired. </p>\n\n<p><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/4118122920/\" title=\"Gedit by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4118122920_e2124a5bec.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" alt=\"Gedit\"></a></p>\n\n<p><br>\nThen I found out that you can run <a href=\"http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/\">gedit</a> on OS X.

A match made in heaven!” No so fast cowboy, some things don’t quite work. Firstly, it doesn’t restore my previous session when I close it. Maybe I should never close it. Haha! I guess that’s one option (god, I find myself saying that a lot lately). Then the fact that the cursor breaks after saving a file sometimes and it doesn’t have a terminal plugin drives me nuts. Especially when trying to develop on a 13\" screen. </p>\n\n<p>My conclusion is I will, for now, stick with gedit. At least until the first phase of this app is done. My trial expired with TextMate and  Aptana pissed me off. Maybe the new version is better? Stay tuned.</p>",

Well, maybe not.\n\nFirst, over labor day weekend, I got my official second guided tour of Chicago. This time, I rode the train, which was a first for me. Not the am track real deal, but the commuter train from Michigan City. Over the course of the weekend, we went to Kumo&rsquo;s corner, a blues bar in lincoln park, a german want to be bar, a bar that served forties in brown paper bags, Harry Carreys restaurant, a place called &ldquo;Happy Village&rdquo;, and a pizza place owned by the guy from Cheap Trick. Now if that&rsquo;s not a weekend, I don&rsquo;t now what is. \n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/3897246478/\" title=\"hory cow, page 2 by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2501/3897246478_7ac112e353.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"hory cow, page 2\"/></a>\n</div>\n\nAnd on that saturday, we drank a lot of this:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/3891117804/\" title=\"Not getting close to this. by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2530/3891117804_93a215a8a1.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Not getting close to this.\"/></a>\n</div>\n\nSo the rest of the month was fairly bland until early october. Its then the Gaslight Anthem rolled through town. The loved ones also played, which was sweet because I love that band and I have never got to see them before. The night ended with seeing Frank Turner play at a bar in downtown Grand Rapids. There is a lot of hype around this guy for reasons I can&rsquo;t quite put my hand on. He&rsquo;s good, and on epitaph records, but I can&rsquo;t say I completely see the appeal.

It was a great time and I wish them the best. I got to ride the trolley and didn&rsquo;t spill a drop on my suit. That&rsquo;s a good in my book. \n\nUnfortunately I haven&rsquo;t got a around to learning python yet. I wrapped up in creating a site using code igniter. Which it good I guess. I have never had to use a PHP MVC (unless of course you considered drupal one). Oh well, the rest of the year awaits. Strike Anywhere and Strung Out released record last week and they sounds really good to these ears.",

It’s getting into the thick of autumn here in southwest michigan and a lot of things have happened since I last updated this thing.

Not the am track real deal, but the commuter train from Michigan City. Over the course of the weekend, we went to Kumo’s corner, a blues bar in lincoln park, a german want to be bar, a bar that served forties in brown paper bags, Harry Carreys restaurant, a place called “Happy Village”, and a pizza place owned by the guy from Cheap Trick.

        "body": "So the idea of officially changing the domain name of this site has been thrown around in my head for the last few months. I own <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com\">joefearnley.com</a> and was thinking about making some sort of personal site (landing page if you will) that directs the user to my different locations on the internet. Social networks, blog, resume, etc&hellip; But I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. So for now, I will keep my blog here and you can see what I&rsquo;m all about on my <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com/about\">about page</a>. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re there for, right?\n\nMy original idea was to purchase a domain like <a href=\"http://jf.com\">jf.com</a> or <a href=\"http://jf.org\">jf.org</a>. Yeah, still trying to keep it simple. The one reason I never wanted to use <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com\">joefearnley.com</a> was because no one could ever spell my last name correctly. Its not that complicated, but you&rsquo;d be surprised what runs through some people&rsquo;s minds. So long story short, I ended up going with <a href=\"http://joef.org\">joef.org</a>. I think it had a good branding, but what the hell do I know? I went to a conference once and the guy giving a talk on personal branding&rsquo;s name was jeff blankenschmidt (or something to that effect). I think if people can remember amazon, they can remember fearnley. \n\nSo I finally made up my mind and <a href=\"http://joef.org\">joef.org</a> is out and <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com\">joefearnley.com</a> is in. But I had the problem with permalinks on the internet. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s not many, but maybe a few on myspace and twitter. Being that I am, for the most part, a retard when it comes to regex and I didn&rsquo;t want to take the time to see what my <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html\">mod_rewrite</a> options were on blue host. I figured writing a php script would take a couple of minutes. And it did. \n\nSo here is my first php tech tip (with syntax highlighting included thanks to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/\">this guy</a>). Put this in your index.php file and if you had the same permalink structure as your last wordpress blog, you should be good to go:\n\n<pre lang=\"PHP\" line=\"1\">\n<?php $jf_url = \"http://joefearnley.com\";\n\n   header(\"location: \" . $jf_url . $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"]);\n   exit();\n?>\n</pre>",

Social networks, blog, resume, etc… But I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. So for now, I will keep my blog here and you can see what I’m all about on my <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com/about\">about page</a>. That’s what they’re there for, right?\n\nMy original idea was to purchase a domain like <a href=\"http://jf.com\">jf.com</a> or <a href=\"http://jf.org\">jf.org</a>. Yeah, still trying to keep it simple. The one reason I never wanted to use <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com\">joefearnley.com</a> was because no one could ever spell my last name correctly. Its not that complicated, but you’d be surprised what runs through some people’s minds. So long story short, I ended up going with <a href=\"http://joef.org\">joef.org</a>. I think it had a good branding, but what the hell do I know? I went to a conference once and the guy giving a talk on personal branding’s name was jeff blankenschmidt (or something to that effect). I think if people can remember amazon, they can remember fearnley. \n\nSo I finally made up my mind and <a href=\"http://joef.org\">joef.org</a> is out and <a href=\"http://joefearnley.com\">joefearnley.com</a> is in. But I had the problem with permalinks on the internet. I’m sure there’s not many, but maybe a few on myspace and twitter.

I scored enough candy to make, if eaten, a grown man sick. Being at the end of the parade was the keep to making this all happen. Then fireworks ensued at dusk.\n\nOn Friday night, before heading up north, we attended a wedding. Rachel&rsquo;s cousin got married. No alcohol was served and they had line dancing as the main event. These two factors combined with Rachel being completely uncomfortable at all family gatherings made the whole thing boring as shit.

Why do you think every rapper (and for that matter, every punk rocker) these days are starting their own clothing line? They have been for years. They saw this shit coming, why can&rsquo;t everyone else? Partly, I think its because when 12-year-old kids see a band on MTV2, they immediately think they are rich.

You may get that big, but you’ll never afford your own jet before the label takes its cut. Why do you think every rapper (and for that matter, every punk rocker) these days are starting their own clothing line? They have been for years. They saw this shit coming, why can’t everyone else? Partly, I think its because when 12-year-old kids see a band on MTV2, they immediately think they are rich. Didn’t TLC or MC Hammer teach us anything?

Shut up and play your guitar, drink your free drinks and meet new chicks in different towns each night. I don’t feel sorry for you. I also question why a magazine that has access to every label in the country asks a questions like this.

The weekend started off with a stop by <a title=\"http://www.rydaly.com/\" href=\"http://www.rydaly.com/\">ry guys</a> with a warm up of carlsbad and the beamer. He lives near the actual logan square which apparently consists of a lot of hispanic patrons. Who knew?\n\nAfter an arguable stretch through the many streets that looked exactly the same, we finally made it to <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boystown,_Chicago\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boystown,_Chicago\">boys town</a>. With no parking spot. Let me know the next time you can luck out as well as I did. Once all was said and done (and a trip to the &lsquo;bay where I saw joe thunderbird. Small world, ehh?), it was back to steve&rsquo;s apartment for chicago-style pizza and a review of blazing saddles. Break&rsquo;s over boys.\n\nSaturday was different story. Actually quite the same. A little car trouble, but nothing that wasn&rsquo;t handled correctly. B. roskowski was getting married and the party ensued. A tranny said dave looked like candy at a store we stopped at. Where was I going with this? Oh yeah, the tequillla bar, where dave was presented with a $200 dollar dinner bill while steve got his bromance on. It was cute though.\n\nAfter another bar and spilled tecate, it was back to steve&rsquo;s apartment. Then, my friends, it was off the the <a title=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-and-l-tavern-chicago\" href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-and-l-tavern-chicago\">L and L</a>. Here, was had a Pabst and listened to some rock tunes. Hoping to see brenden kelly, the night did not go uneventful. The next stop was the wiener circle where I got chewed out by hotdog maker and told by a guy with a pony knob that if I kept up my attitude I would be biting the curb. Oh well, his loss. The whole thing was a little but like this. Only that it was St. Patty&rsquo;s day weekend and the first niced-weathered day of the year.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vo1LPf9mnyU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/vo1LPf9mnyU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></div>\nThe night ended with a last beer at ricks and a cab ride home. Unfortunately, <a title=\"http://www.alsbeef.com/\" href=\"http://www.alsbeef.com/\">Al&rsquo;s italian beef</a> was closed on our way back to kalamazoo on wednesday, so no cheese stakes were had.

        "body": "Over the course of this past weekend I got on the build kick. Woods and nails, that is. I began with the intentions of a shoe rack to finally get those things organized in my garage. I seem to be holding on to footwear I don&rsquo;t really use or necessarily need. Why? Nostalgia. The pairs seem to remind of different spots in my life when I wore them (or never wore them at all, so I guess when I bought them). Sentimental values hold strong in me for some reason. When being reminded of the past, I should definitely be thinking about the future.\n\nBefore the first board was cut for the shoe rack, I moved straight to designing the desk for the brownout server room. Well, I guess the first step was the refrigerator, but that was a short one. Half-step if you will. And yes, the brown out does have a server room. Its really more or less a spot to store all of my extra computers, but I&rsquo;m still thinking I will find a good use for these things one day. I was thinking porn aggregation. You know, set up a server farm that crawls the internet for free porn, set up some advertising. Maybe this could be a second income. Maybe not.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/3297319983/\" title=\"IMAGE_596 by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3503/3297319983_bd04f5cd26_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" alt=\"IMAGE_596\"/></a></p>\n\nMaybe I should serve up the nostalgic parts of my life. In my eyes. With pictures. Does that make sense? Probably not. Some say I have more shit than I need. Seriously though, who here has a magic eight ball telephone?

        "body": "While slacking on this blog, I just realized that I never made an entry about the boo boo juice party we had at the brownout a couple of weeks back. I really only remember about half of it and ended up on my bedroom floor way to early. Oh well, I guess that&rsquo;s the way these things happen some times. You win some, you lose some, but ultimately you take what you can get.\n\nOne of the reason for my early retirement that night may have been the night before.

I got my car stuck in my driveway on friday night on my way to pick up a pizza and again this mourning trying to pull in. When I returned from the pizza joint I decided to park in the other driveway being that it was shoveled. Big mistake. I realized that its quite the luxury to start a car in the mourning when its been in a garage all night. The outside temperature said 9 degrees on saturday mourning and on my way to the store I realized my dashboard was litterally frozen. Yet once we got to the store, the purchase of a new, nicer shovel was required. While digging my car out of the snow friday night, the frozen air did a number on the thick plastic of the previous one. </p>\n\n<p>Because of these frigid conditions, I didn&rsquo;t spend that much time outside this week. This gave me time to write a new song and somewhat geek out. First, I replace the hard drive on the macbook which was basically a breeze. The hard part is going to be moving all of my data back to the new installation. I also attempted to build a &ldquo;triple boot&rdquo; scenario. I wanted to try <a title=\"windows 7\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/\">windows 7.</a> and being that I have a much larger hard drive now, I thought I would install ubuntu as well. It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. Being that its sort of unknown territory with windows 7, I thought I would have a lot more trouble. The only problem I have now is the wifi on linux, but what else is new? Maybe I can create a tutorial for this. Probably not.</p>\n\n<p>I do have to say though, I am running <a title=\"google chrome\" href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">google chrome</a> on windows 7 as I type this (as well as my work computer) and am really liking.

Really only a couple milestones in my life were passed. And when I say milestone, I say financial endeavors that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have taken. Yet looking back, I really don&rsquo;t regret it.\n\nDuring the first part of the year, I purchased a house. It&rsquo;s probably one of the most unique ones I have encountered in my life. First thing was first, I built a bar in the basement and was on my way. I also purchased a new automobile. This was certainly needed and now I have an ipod adapter so my shit&rsquo;s going totally digital. A bit scary, but unevitable.\n\nAs far as resolutions go this year, I was a little behind once I crossed that line. I certainly did blog more, but excercise was about nill. I plan to turn this around in 2009. I want to consistainly keep up with the blog, but keeping up with a healthier lifestyle is higher up on the list. Tomorrow starts a new test of overall self control. Oh, and I want to get this rock and roll endevour moving in a faster direction. Looking back I had something in my hand that I let slip right through the tips because of laziness. This year, that&rsquo;s gotta change.\n\nSpeaking of music, I also compilied a list of my favorite listened to music of 2008. In no particular order.\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Shorebirds - <em>Its Gonna Get Ugly</em></li>\n\t<li>The Gaslight Anthem - <em>The &lsquo;59 Sound</em> and <em>The Senor and the Queen</em></li>\n\t<li>Polar Bear Club - <em>Sometimes Things Just Disappear</em></li>\n\t<li>Smartbomb - <em>Chaos And Lawlessness</em></li>\n\t<li>Joey Cape - <em>Bridge</em></li>\n\t<li>Cheeky - <em>Choke On A Cheeseburger</em></li>\n\t<li>Dillinger Four - <em>CIVILWAR</em></li>\n\t<li>Dead to Me - <em>Little Brother</em></li>\n</ul>\nThe things to point out here is that I am totally predictable when it comes to music. There were other things I listened to a lot last year, but they were not released within the 365 days, so I feel like I cannot put them on this list.\n\nOne last thing to mention here is that I have started <a title=\"the browncast\" href=\"http://thebrowncast.joef.org/\">a podcast</a>. This is something that I didn&rsquo;t really plan on in 2008, but the ball is rolling and we plan to continue. 2009, here we come.",

                "content": "<p><p>After a couple of weeks off of the blog, I feel I have to reflect on another year in life gone past. 2008, like past years, was an interesting one. Really only a couple milestones in my life were passed. And when I say milestone, I say financial endeavors that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have taken. Yet looking back, I really don&rsquo;t regret it.\n\nDuring the first part of the year, I purchased a house. It&rsquo;s probably one of the most unique ones I have encountered in my life. First thing was first, I built a bar in the basement and was on my way. I also purchased a new automobile. This was certainly needed and now I have an ipod adapter so my shit&rsquo;s going totally digital. A bit scary, but unevitable.\n\nAs far as resolutions go this year, I was a little behind once I crossed that line. I certainly did blog more, but excercise was about nill. I plan to turn this around in 2009. I want to consistainly keep up with the blog, but keeping up with a healthier lifestyle is higher up on the list. Tomorrow starts a new test of overall self control. Oh, and I want to get this rock and roll endevour moving in a faster direction.

It wasn&rsquo;t as lively as the first and Rachel&rsquo;s attitude was a little off, but some good content came out of it and I am looking forward to the next one. I have yet to get the thing on itunes, but for now you can get the feed <a title=\"http://browncast.joef.org/feed/\" href=\"http://browncast.joef.org/feed/\">here</a>. We called this one the official first episode.

Its been a long time since <em>Revolutions Per Minute</em>, <em>The Illusion of Safety</em>, and <em>From here to Infirmary</em>. I understand bands mature and sounds change. I just find it a little difficult to handle some times.</p>\n\n<p>As for the forthcoming week, its a short work one and I get to eat a shit load of food and see the family. My plan is to bring pizza rolls as my dish to pass. I have a feeling everyone will have an opinion of my non-traditional dish, but I guarantee there will be no more left once its leaving time.</p>",

I have yet to get the thing on itunes, but for now you can get the feed <a title=\"http://browncast.joef.org/feed/\" href=\"http://browncast.joef.org/feed/\">here</a>. We called this one the official first episode. It was a lot of fun and there will certainly be more to come.</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday night I went to the orbit room to see <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gaslight_Anthem\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gaslight_Anthem\">The Gaslight Anthem</a>, <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Against\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_Against\">Rise Against</a>, <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrice\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrice\">Thrice</a> and <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_Trio\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaline_Trio\">The Alkaline Trio</a>. It was a hell of a time. The <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gaslight_Anthem\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gaslight_Anthem\">gaslight anthem</a> rocked it harder than I thought they would. Our prediction is the band is going to be huge one day. For the others, I guess I have jut gotten too far removed from these bands. Its been a long time since <em>Revolutions Per Minute</em>, <em>The Illusion of Safety</em>, and <em>From here to Infirmary</em>. I understand bands mature and sounds change. I just find it a little difficult to handle some times.</p>\n\n<p>As for the forthcoming week, its a short work one and I get to eat a shit load of food and see the family. My plan is to bring pizza rolls as my dish to pass. I have a feeling everyone will have an opinion of my non-traditional dish, but I guarantee there will be no more left once its leaving time.</p>",

                "content": "<p>Lately I have been getting a little fed up with my cell phone. I am at the point now where I have to charge the thing at least everyday. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad, but I used to be able to get three days out of it with no problem. It doesn&rsquo;t help that I have multiple applications running on it most of the time, but I think windows mobile should take some responsibility for that.</p>\n\n<p>The kicker here is this phone is not even a year old. My two year contract is up next june with T-Mobile and the fact that two phones over the course of that time can&rsquo;t even make it is ridiculous. I was thinking about getting an iphone once my contract is up, but what happens if I plan to use it as my ipod as well? Bye bye battery life, hello dead air.

I don&rsquo;t know how old this episode is, but how have I not heard of these two? With all of these labels falling by the wayside and a plethora of good music out there today, its hard to understand how these girls are on mtv and that they are obviously making money.</p>\n\n<p>Its OK though, I&rsquo;m not bitter. Their sixteen and have brand new benz. I am twenty-six and have a scion. At least I know how to operate mine. And mudvayne has gone easy listening. Maybe its more marketable to the mtv generation?</p>",

My problem is coming up with things to write about a few times a week without sounding like an idiot or posting you tube videos and making a smart ass remark about it.

Maybe I should make a new years resolution to only make posts like that?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the reasons I wanted to create more posts this year was to get better at writing. As you can tell from pretty much this pass year, it’s probably declined if anything. I don&rsquo;t know how to form sentences correctly, I have a hard time disguising where to stop and start a paragraph, and my grammar is that of a 10th grade high school student. I guess I was hoping repetition would take hold and bring me to the next level. So much for that.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regardless, I&rsquo;m gonna keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing. It seems to be working and to be honest no one really reads these posts anyway. Trust me, I read the metrics. The only time it ever goes up is when I create a post and have to revise it increasing my page views along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, I&rsquo;m off to north part of the mitten.

                "content": "<p>I set a goal this week to write a blog entry everyday. Being that I will away from a computer for three days after tonight, I thought I would try to squeak one out. So with small amount of hope, here goes&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>I set a goal at the beginning of the year to make more blog posts. Now that the year is slowly winding down, I find myself trying to make up for the lost time I missed during most of the autumn of this year. I don&rsquo;t know if any of you have tried to consistently update a blog, but it&rsquo;s a little difficult to do. Wait, let me re-phrase that, it&rsquo;s difficult to consistently make blog posts that are opinionative on a certain subject, I suppose unless you have nothing to do all day. Then it would probably a snap. My problem is coming up with things to write about a few times a week without sounding like an idiot or posting you tube videos and making a smart ass remark about it. This is a simple way to get a post in, but doesn&rsquo;t take that much thought. Maybe I should start taking that route to fill in some of the gaps? Maybe I should make a new years resolution to only make posts like that?</p>\n<p>One of the reasons I wanted to create more posts this year was to get better at writing. As you can tell from pretty much this pass year, it&rsquo;s probably declined if anything. I don&rsquo;t know how to form sentences correctly, I have a hard time disguising where to stop and start a paragraph, and my grammar is that of a 10th grade high school student.

Bear Lake, MI is a great place and I kind of can&rsquo;t wait until I can return.\n<a title=\"sky by joefearnley, on Flickr\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/2776943110/\"></a>\n</p><p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2776943110_58aeb6e7f8_m.jpg\">External image</div></p>\nThe rain came and went, but we drank and swore like sailors. And sailing we did. If you call sitting on an aqua patio for hours at a time listening to classic rock sailing. If their is one thing I learned on this trip, it to always wear your sun screen. Oh and to always wear your helmet.\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3250/2776090603_1f896bda41.jpg\">External image</div></p>\nI will return northern Michigan.

        "body": "So last week I decided to take the plunge, sign my life away, and purchase a new automobile. Its kind of an exciting time. The monte carlo took a giant crap on me only to be left on the the side of the road with no cell phone. Nope, I&rsquo;ll never make that mistake again. And when I mean mistake I don&rsquo;t mean letting my car take a crap on me but simply never let my cell phone out of my site for more than thirty minutes. Its a long story that I don&rsquo;t want to get into and the point is I was left without a car.\n\nBeing that the when this happened the summer was just beginning and if I worked even remotely close the where I work, I would have rode my bike every chance I could. But this wasn&rsquo;t the case and after two week of car pooling with rachel, she began to get a little annoyed. My only option left: buy a new car.\n\nI thought about this one hard and long.

Dave and I spent a good portion of friday night and saturday mourning trying to get the kegerator to flow right.

First of all, I had half of a tree fall down on my cable line in my front yard. It was pretty wild, but ultimately we got over it and met some new neighbors along the way. Nice guys, nice guys. They came over with the chainsaw and took care of business. If anyone wants some kinilin, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>On to event two. I went to the greek fest last night and got to see the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Blossoms\">gin blossoms</a> play.  My mid-nighties rock dream finally came true. One of the first songs I ever learned on the guitar was hey jealousy. I gotta say it was really fun until the rain came. Then, in my punk rock prowess, I tried to get adam up to crowd surf and apparently you cant do that. So he was kicked out and I was toast for the remainder of the night. But hey, for being fifteen years in the past, the <a href=\"http://ginblossoms.com\">gin blossoms</a> made it fun.</p>\n\n<p>In my third venture, I have to say, some people just could be a lot nicer. I went to a vegan barbecue and apparently some people don&rsquo;t take liking to the fact that I think <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/\" title=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/\">airheads</a> is the best film ever made.

Well not exactly. The detroit red wings won the STANLEY CUP. Thats right, the wings took the steel city and it was totally awesome. I guess the shitty part about the whole thing was not hearing the  detroit fans in the crowd once was all said and done. When Nick Lindstrom picked up that cup and skated around with it, I was waiting for the roar of the crowd but it wasn&rsquo;t there. My theory was they would win in five which probably should have happened but what are you going to do? Wings win, I shave my face, and all is good in the fearnley house hold. My sister is turning thirty next week and I am having a party. The kegs will be flowing and the bar will be hooked up. Come on over. Once is all said and done, I wont remember a thing.</p>",

First of all, I had half of a tree fall down on my cable line in my front yard. It was pretty wild, but ultimately we got over it and met some new neighbors along the way. Nice guys, nice guys. They came over with the chainsaw and took care of business. If anyone wants some kinilin, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>On to event two. I went to the greek fest last night and got to see the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_Blossoms\">gin blossoms</a> play.  My mid-nighties rock dream finally came true. One of the first songs I ever learned on the guitar was hey jealousy. I gotta say it was really fun until the rain came. Then, in my punk rock prowess, I tried to get adam up to crowd surf and apparently you cant do that. So he was kicked out and I was toast for the remainder of the night. But hey, for being fifteen years in the past, the <a href=\"http://ginblossoms.com\">gin blossoms</a> made it fun.</p>\n\n<p>In my third venture, I have to say, some people just could be a lot nicer. I went to a vegan barbecue and apparently some people don’t take liking to the fact that I think <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/\" title=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109068/\">airheads</a> is the best film ever made.

I watched <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/\" title=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/\">pretty in pink</a> today and must admit that it might just trump both of them.</p>\n\n<p>And for my final awesome part of the week, I cut my hair. Well not exactly. The detroit red wings won the STANLEY CUP. Thats right, the wings took the steel city and it was totally awesome. I guess the shitty part about the whole thing was not hearing the  detroit fans in the crowd once was all said and done. When Nick Lindstrom picked up that cup and skated around with it, I was waiting for the roar of the crowd but it wasn’t there. My theory was they would win in five which probably should have happened but what are you going to do? Wings win, I shave my face, and all is good in the fearnley house hold. My sister is turning thirty next week and I am having a party. The kegs will be flowing and the bar will be hooked up. Come on over. Once is all said and done, I wont remember a thing.</p>",

        "body": "<p>OK, so I am a bit late on this one, but I am on vacation, Thats my excuse and I&rsquo;m sticking to it. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t get to go to new york, but the weather was nice here in west michigan and I got a lot of work done around the house. I cooked a lot of hamburgers, watch the dustin hoffman biography, and finally held band practice. Lets hope the ball will keep rolling on this. If anyone out there wants to play the bass in a punk band, just let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I did was get to see a lot of television over the last five days. Twice I saw the red wings lose.  Tonight&rsquo;s a different story though. I say wings over the pens in five, I&rsquo;m calling it right now. I also got to watch <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_to_Drive\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_to_Drive\">licence to drive</a> this weekend. Its one of my favorites and never gets old.

Its really got to do with the fact that most of the players who participated in the glory days of the mid to late nineties have either retired or have gone on to new things. No more Steve Yzerman or Brendan Shannahan, no more Mike Vernon or Patrick Roy, no more Claude Lemieux and certainly no more Dino Ciccarelli. Of course there are still a couple of hanger ons like Joe Sakic and Nick Listrom (and I suppose you could include Darren McCarty), but I dont recall how much of an impact these guys had on the whole situation. Maybe a little, but more a a finesse factor than a physical one. If you can prove me wrong on this one, feel free to comment.\n\nI’m pretty confident about the wings at this point. The past few years they’ve blown in the the first round against one of the lowest seeded teams. With that behind them at this point, I hope they can get back in the groove of things especially after being off for a few days.\n\nLets see a few memories shall we:\n\n<object height=\"355\" width=\"425\">\n<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/C7DlAjrhm9s&amp;hl=en\">\n<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/C7DlAjrhm9s&amp;hl=en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"355\" width=\"425\"></embed></object></p>",

        "body": "<img src=\"http://joef.org/wp-content/themes/couch/images/wikipedia.png\" class=\"imbedded-image\"/>\nThis story happened to catch my internet waves yesterday. Well, I guess its not really a story, its a documentary about <a href=\"http://wikipedia.com\" title=\"wikipedia\">wikipedia</a> and the freedom of the internet as a communication medium. It touches on idea of &ldquo;web 2.0&rdquo; regarding social networks, blogs, etc. and if this direction the world is turning is good or bad. I suppose we all have our opinions and after seeing this I am not sure where I stand on letting any geek off the street declaring &ldquo;facts&rdquo; as &ldquo;facts&rdquo;.  I do remember the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica\" title=\"e b\">encyclopedia britannica</a> commercials of the 80&rsquo;s where the blond-haired dude stands in front of a book shelf trying to sell america on these things.  I had the whole set growing up and referenced them on every report I had to do.\n\nThe african guy brings up the issue - can we produce knowledge as a community?

                "content": "<p>Spring has finally sprung here in michigan (meaning that its reflected in the weather as opposed to the official date a few weeks ago). This sunday doesn&rsquo;t only become special because its getting warmer, but because today the red wings play their last game of the regular season. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I am totally excited for this year&rsquo;s post season. I made a<a href=\"http://joef.org/2007/11/11/oh-canada/\" title=\"oh canada\"> couple </a>of <a href=\"http://joef.org/2007/11/12/keep-your-head-up/\" title=\"keep your head up\">blog entries</a> about this NHL season claiming I will watch it more, but the plan never really had a follow through.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"http://joef.org/wp-content/themes/couch/images/redwings_sm.jpg\">External image</div><br />\nAnyway, I have a feeling about this year.It seems every single year, the red wings perform totally awesome during the regular season and totally biff it when the playoffs come. These past years seem to always link back to how bad the goalies performed. There is no excuse this year. With <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Osgood\" title=\"osgood\">Osbad</a> making the all-star  team, I see nothing holding them back.  Seriously, who the hell would have ever seen that one coming? <a href=\"http://henrikzetterberg.com/\" title=\"zetterberg\">Zetterberg</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chelios\" title=\"Chris Chelios\">chelios</a> taking the day off better produce some results - Nashville is going down.</p>\n\n<p>In other news, I have made a lot of progress on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157604376313717/\" title=\"bar\">my basement bar</a> over the last couple of weeks. I have been documenting the process with <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/sets/72157604376313717/\" title=\"bar\">some photos</a>. I built the majority of it with a combination of cheap plywood and pieces of 2x4&rsquo;s. I got a lot of my inspiration from a <a href=\"http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=640633\" title=\"bar\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=574277\" title=\"bar\">forums</a> I found on the net. Like <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/d2lee\" title=\"david lee\">dave</a> always says, when in doubt, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&amp;hs=8kG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=build+a+home+bar&amp;spell=1\" title=\"google it\">google that shit</a>. Regardless, I have a long way to go. I have to cover the out side with paneling, cover the top, add some paint, and trim the edges. I have to wait to for a cash refill and we will be on our way. So far I have learned a lot about wood working and how much you can use old materials to really half-ass things.</p>\n\n<p>There was a <a href=\"http://blog.mlive.com/phoblographer/2008/03/spot_news_stinks_literally.html\" title=\"gas leak\">gas leak right by my old place</a>.Good thing I dont live there anymore.

Does building with wood pieces and saving yourself for marriage really make you an incarnation of (a) god? I personally dont know. I also dont know if the religous-based morale of current society is just one big ball of wrong. As far as I am concern, spirituality is a personal thing. If your a evangelist, leave me out of it.

Whatever, I guess I have to read more bible. The thing is its only the 23rd of march this year and I am wondering why its celebrated so early. Maybe the government bigwigs are going on spring break this year? My other question is how the hell a rabbit got wrapped up in the whole celebration. I dont have internet access at the moment, so I guess I have to research that one. Ahh the power of the world wide web.</p>\n\n<p>In other news, I came to muskegon for the first time since christmas. I got to see the fam, friends fam, and score an original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"NES\">nintendo entertainment system</a>. It didn&rsquo;t come with any cords or controllers or games, but I am told it works, so I have to hit up ebay when I get home. If anyone wants to get rid of some nintendo games let me know. I have three games that I need to need first - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson's_Punch-Out!!\" title=\"mike tyson's punch out\">Mike Tyson&rsquo;s Punch Out</a>,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda\" title=\"the legend of zelda\"> The Legend of Zelda</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.C._Pro-Am\" title=\"RC Pro-Am\">R.C. Pro-Am</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and I have entered the crazy world of  DIY word working. I am planning on building a bar in my basement with a bunch of left over wood the dude that lived in the house before left behind. I&rsquo;ve got crazy ideas, a new saw, and a mound of inspiration, so lets see if any of this sees the light of day. And if you haven&rsquo;t signed up for <a href=\"http://hulu.com\" title=\"hulu\">hulu</a> yet, get over there and start watching. This is the future of television.  And if you haven&rsquo;t  seen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Give\" title=\"the small give\">oprah&rsquo;s new show</a>, its just like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster%27s_Millions_%281985_film%29\" title=\"brewsters millions\">brewster&rsquo;s millions</a> so dont waste your time and cut straight to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088850/\" title=\"brewsters millions\">the movie</a>. Got to get tough, Go Joe!</p>",

It works extremely well and the orignial  owner left an ass load of glass of the basement so if you ever enter my place, you may see severel pseudo white boards spread throughout my home.

I learned an ass load about internal residential plumbing and the dangers of  gas in the home.</p>\n\n<p>I plan on having a blowout downtown before I move out. If you are in a band that wants to play or a guy/girl that wants to have a good time, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>And I really love that ubuntu&rsquo;s  firefox browser does a totally shitting job of rendering letters. I cant tell if there&rsquo;s space or not. So excuse me. And it appears that McDonald&rsquo;s gave in and let others use their name in commercials.</p>",

I am extremely disappointed that I am currently missing the last episode of <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/thewire/\" title=\"the wire\">the wire</a>. Bag that, I am pissed off and rachel is hearing all about it. At least I didnt miss because I forgot that today was the day we spring head.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless I have a new place to live and a somewhat new outlook on life. I have a new lab which means a new place to create music. A new place to create web applications. A new place to create&hellip;&hellip;its endless. I have to say that I am a little bummed I have to move. I had a bunch of good memories of this place.</p>\n\n<p>I got locked out twice. Once I had to scale the side of the building in the middle of winter using rachel as boost to get in. Another I walked over to <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=113890011\" title=\"harveys\">harveys</a>, played pinball and drank beer until I received phone call.  I had few gatherings there. None were real good until the spring came and we fired up the drums at seven in the mourning to hear against the east wall of the state theater. I remember hearing the <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=113381995\" title=\"pbr\">poor bastards revolt</a> and some young hipsters paying rock music in the street around the corner, then walking down the street to see them.Many more good time, I just cannot take the space hear. Walking to the park is awesome. Hearing the park even awesomer. Here&rsquo;s to 2008, bring me something good.</p>\n\n<p>In other news, I just bought the mistic pizza / say anything dvd combination and plan on watching it. Of course after I finish the chapelle show season 2.</p>",

And if it does, <a href=\"http://getfirefox.com\" title=\"firefox\">think about changing lanes.</a></p>\n\n<p>In other news, I think I joined <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thedimestoresaints\" title=\"the dime store saints\">a band</a>. Well, actually kind of start one. After the first rock session this week, I have a good feeling. Its going have soul and it rips. I hope I get some inspiration this weekend after attending  <a href=\"http://www.thelovedonesband.com/\" title=\"the loved ones\">the loved ones </a>show this weekend. Oh, and the <a href=\"http://www.gaslightanthem.com/\" title=\"the gaslight anthem.\">gaslight anthem</a> is playing as well (shit yeah !!). This new EP of theirs is  totally rad to my ears. My only complaint is that its only four songs  thus am afraid that I might get sick of it too quickly. I would have an opinion on the new loved ones, but the best buy and no other store in my neck of the woods carries it. I really dont want to make this digital transition but unfortunately its inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>joe</p>",

It just looks way to chinsy for my careless ass. I was hoping for a smaller version of the macbook pro. Same look, only smaller with a 12” wide screen. It’s appears to be the same size as the mac book, only thinner.  No optical drive, only one usb port, and no firewire drives me away.

Now, this is where I ran into trouble. I also found out my router has a built-in application for dynamic dns. My question at this point was do I use one, the other, or both? First I need to configure port forwarding on my router. 80 to 80, 22 to 22 to my local ubuntu server - 192.168.0.111. I try all three options and I get nothing. At this point I can ping <a href=\"http://joef.no-ip.org\" title=\"joef.no-ip.org\">joef.no-ip.org </a>and the public ip address and get a response.

The cable guy set it up and I never gave it a second thought. Just plugged in my d-link and was on my way.\n\nSo now I have way too many variables in the mix, it really could be a shit load of things. I then try to set up port forwarding on my dsl router. That doesnt seem to work. My mentality was that I can forward port 80 to the dlink, then forward that on to the server. According to what I read on the internet, things dont work that way. At this point, I am tired and I want to go to bed.\n\nThen today, at work, I am sitting there pondering this and it hits me - PLUG THE SERVER INTO THE DSL ROUTER!!!! Wow, why the shit didnt I think of this before? So I get home from work connect the server to the dsl router. It gave it an ip address right away. I configure port forwarding for the web server, restart the router, check <a href=\"http://joef.no-ip.org\" title=\"joef.no-ip.org\">http://joef.no-ip.org</a> and it works. How refreshing.

Ubuntu has a built-in package for <a href=\"http://no-ip.com\">no-ip.com</a> called&hellip;.you guessed it&hellip;.no-ip. All I have to do was run the following command, follow the directions, enter in my account information and I was all set.\n<p>sudo apt-get install no-ip</p>\nIt automatically adds it to the start up scripts. Now, this is where I ran into trouble. I also found out my router has a built-in application for dynamic dns. My question at this point was do I use one, the other, or both? First I need to configure port forwarding on my router. 80 to 80, 22 to 22 to my local ubuntu server - 192.168.0.111. I try all three options and I get nothing. At this point I can ping <a href=\"http://joef.no-ip.org\" title=\"joef.no-ip.org\">joef.no-ip.org </a>and the public ip address and get a response. So I know its out there resolving the ip address properly, it just cant connect to the server.\n\nSo, to add add more confusion to the matter, I forgot that I have a separate router that doubles as a modem for my dsl line. until not that long ago, I didnt even realize this thing was a router, a wireless one at that. The cable guy set it up and I never gave it a second thought. Just plugged in my d-link and was on my way.\n\nSo now I have way too many variables in the mix, it really could be a shit load of things. I then try to set up port forwarding on my dsl router. That doesnt seem to work. My mentality was that I can forward port 80 to the dlink, then forward that on to the server. According to what I read on the internet, things dont work that way. At this point, I am tired and I want to go to bed.\n\nThen today, at work, I am sitting there pondering this and it hits me - PLUG THE SERVER INTO THE DSL ROUTER!!!! Wow, why the shit didnt I think of this before? So I get home from work connect the server to the dsl router. It gave it an ip address right away. I configure port forwarding for the web server, restart the router, check <a href=\"http://joef.no-ip.org\" title=\"joef.no-ip.org\">http://joef.no-ip.org</a> and it works. How refreshing. If there is one thing I am learning from this its how little I know about networking.\n\nSo, as my list gets smaller I have the following to go:\n<ul>\n\t<li>ssh - to connect to the box remotely</li>\n\t<li>ftpd - send files to and from</li>\n\t<li>samba - share files locally (still debating)</li>\n\t<li>subversion - version software projects</li>\n</ul>\nAfter this I guess its onto configuring samba and getting some shared folders going across then network. I guess goonies really don&rsquo;t die.</p>",

After a bit of research and a couple hours of development, I had a basic version up and running on my local network. My idea is to have a basic landing page we you initially arrive to it containing the name of the site, possibly a logo, and a list of the latest five blogs I did. Then at the bottom, there will be a link to the archives page which will list all of the blog entries.\n\nI have most of this completed already. It was fairly easy. I just took some of the code that I already developed, stripped it down, tweaked it, and that that was that. The thing I really like about do this is it forced me to get right down to the basics of user accessibility. When you don&rsquo;t have a mouse and the machine you use is like a computer built in 1994, you get a good sense of how to lay things out so a user can have immediate access to all of the site without having to drill down to far.\n\nI havent decided on a logo yet. If I do, it may be a stripped down version of the header graphic on the regular site. I also haven&rsquo;t decided to add administration features yet. That seems a bit too excessive seeming is how I am the only one that blogs on this thing and can imagine a time when I would need to blog about something from my phone. Plus its really hot here in the lab this time of year and I don&rsquo;t want to spend any more time that I have to in there. But, since I figured out how to access the development box via ssh and opened port 80 on it, I can do all of the development from my now air-conditioned bedroom. But who wants to be coooked up in a before when you could be out enjoying this wonderful summer sun? Not me.\n\nI guess my next step is to figure out the graphic situation. Also, I need to devise a plan on how to detect mobile browsers. I have read a couple of articles and it seems its just a matter of determining the user agent.\n\nso with a little this:\n<pre>\n    $uaheader = $_SERVER[\"HTTP_USER_AGENT\"];</pre>\nand a little of that:\n<pre>\n    if($uaheader = '_some_user_agent_')\n        // redirect to mobile version</pre>\nI should be all set.

After a bit of research and a couple hours of development, I had a basic version up and running on my local network. My idea is to have a basic landing page we you initially arrive to it containing the name of the site, possibly a logo, and a list of the latest five blogs I did. Then at the bottom, there will be a link to the archives page which will list all of the blog entries.\n\nI have most of this completed already. It was fairly easy. I just took some of the code that I already developed, stripped it down, tweaked it, and that that was that. The thing I really like about do this is it forced me to get right down to the basics of user accessibility. When you don’t have a mouse and the machine you use is like a computer built in 1994, you get a good sense of how to lay things out so a user can have immediate access to all of the site without having to drill down to far.\n\nI havent decided on a logo yet. If I do, it may be a stripped down version of the header graphic on the regular site. I also haven’t decided to add administration features yet. That seems a bit too excessive seeming is how I am the only one that blogs on this thing and can imagine a time when I would need to blog about something from my phone. Plus its really hot here in the lab this time of year and I don’t want to spend any more time that I have to in there. But, since I figured out how to access the development box via ssh and opened port 80 on it, I can do all of the development from my now air-conditioned bedroom. But who wants to be coooked up in a before when you could be out enjoying this wonderful summer sun? Not me.\n\nI guess my next step is to figure out the graphic situation. Also, I need to devise a plan on how to detect mobile browsers. I have read a couple of articles and it seems its just a matter of determining the user agent.\n\nso with a little this:\n<pre>\n    $uaheader = $_SERVER[\"HTTP_USER_AGENT\"];</pre>\nand a little of that:\n<pre>\n    if($uaheader = '_some_user_agent_')\n        // redirect to mobile version</pre>\nI should be all set.

I added a couple of feeds from some sites I have accounts with to utilize the sharing that these services have to offer. A snippet of javascript makes integrating these things a snap.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"/wp-content/themes/couch/images/Jaiku_logo.png\">External image</div></p>\n\n<p>First of all, I decided to sign up for one of these micro-blogging services. Since <a href=\"http://pownce.com\">pownce</a> doesn&rsquo;t want to let me in yet, I decided to go with <a href=\"http://jaiku.com\">jaiku</a>. Its kind of cool, yet I don&rsquo;t have any friends on the site, so I guess its a bit point less. Its seems these means of communication are getting just down right out of control. I get really turned off by facebook when I log on and my landing page its chucked full of a bunch shit I don&rsquo;t really care about. I really don&rsquo;t care if so and so when shopping at the mall, or such and such just got done taking a shit. And no, I don&rsquo;t want a gift from you and certainly don&rsquo;t want to join your beer pong players anonymous group. I guess thats the direction the social networking world is heading, so I might as well embrace it, or get the fuck out. So I&rsquo;ll start with <a href=\"http://joefearnley.jaiku.com\">jaiku</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So back to my point. Last week I was looking at my news feeds on my site and saw it hadn&rsquo;t been updated in a while. My original plan was to enter these news links manually, only putting the ones I choose from digg on there. Well, its a bit cumbersome to do that, so I thought about incorporating <a href=\"http://www.digg.com/users/joefearnley/news/dugg\">my digg feed</a> into <a href=\"http://joef.org\">joef.org</a>. I did this a long time ago with a little PHP parsing magic, but removed it for whatever reason. Then I thought about seeing what the digg api had to offer. It turned out to be more complicated that I thought it would be, so I reverted back to the PHP parsing I originally created. then with a little searching around the digg site, I saw you can add custom feeds to your site with a little javascript snippet created right these as you set the filters. Then I saw yesterday mourning that they added a widget to the plethora of integration tools. Its very similar to the <a href=\"http://jaiku.com/settings/badge\">jaiku one</a> I set up on my site as well. Custom colors and even size.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess I&rsquo;ll rock these integration tools for a while. But remember, as  George Keith Funston would say - Automation does not make optimism obsolete.</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"external-image-wrapper\" data-loading-text=\"Loading...\" data-src=\"/wp-content/themes/couch/images/lagwagon_duhbig.jpg\">External image</div></p>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, and this just in&hellip;it appears <a href=\"http://fatwreck.com\">fat wreck chords</a> is releasing some of its back catalog on vinyl, beginning with <a href=\"http://www.punknews.org/article/24779\">Lagwagon&rsquo;s DUH</a>. I don&rsquo;t really buy any vinyl, but this would be sweet ass to own.</p>\n\n<p>joe</p>",

I gotta say those dudes are truly rockin’ and definitely nice guys It might just take the cake as the show of the summer. My favorite kind with the drinks flowing and only about 20-30 people in attendance singing along to all the words. Given the opportunity these guys really might goes places. Wherever that may be I will still be a fan. Of course their next tour with Against Me! wont hurt a lick. Oh yeah, I was diggin’ the smashing blumpkins. Interesting shit, jason wasnt really feeling the jokes though.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/855907718/\" title=\"IMAGE_037 by joefearnley, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1191/855907718_aeb69fcb77_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"192\" alt=\"IMAGE_037\"></a></p>\n\n<p>For the last two months I cannot stop listening to this sink or swim record. I fire the ol’ mp3 player up on my way home from work and its all I want to hear. Well that and of course the latest <a href=\"http://www.strungout.com\">Strung Out</a> jam. Blackhawks Over Los Angeles is really growing on me. I began reading the forums and the negative feedback from these posters prior to the release and it almost got to me. Of course like every strung out record prior to this one, it takes several listens before it clicks. I guess this one just took a few more. But, I gotta say, its growing on me more and more and is a prefect change of pace to gaslight anthem’s. I got a feeling listening to both of these in the future is going to remind me of summer of ‘07. The perfect ending, if it happens, will certainly be seeing strung out play before football season hits forth gear.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this past weekend was a blast. Took a road trip, rock and roll show, golf, seeing craig get his naked ass spanked by three strippers….what more could you want?</p>\n\n<p>Joe</p>",

I guess it is far to say that detroit would have had a great shot in the finals, but who knows. When you are facing some one like daniel alfredson, you really can’t predict anything. I mean, not only being a god in some countries, he carried the senators on his back through the playoffs. HE had the mvp in his pocket but it not a whole lot of help from his teammates. And I just love how he shoots the puck at neidemeyer. It just shows that you can be a hard ass and be the top producer in the nhl playoffs.</p>\n\n\t<p>I just have to think that canadians are throwing rocks right now. Who would of thought a team from south california would be the stanley cup champions? Not me. I guess that things are chaniging but I dont know for the better or the worse. One thing that makes me want to vomit at moments is when nbc pans to that idiot named pierre that talks in the space between the benches. I always hope the guy catches a puck to the eye so we dont have to listen to his halfass game analasys or interviews;</p>\n\n\t<p>Oh, and I just realized that scott and rob neidermyer are brothers. I actually that the two were the same person. No wonder I always had them mixed up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>update:</strong> this really is not an update, I just want eveyone to know that I vaugely remeber writing this three weeks ago and am finally posting it.</p>\n\n\t<p>joe</p>",

Regardless, the thought of getting drunk with one of my friends each week, talk about bullshit, and record it sounds like a fun idea. I am thinking <a href=\"http://labs.joef.org\">the lab</a> just found a new project. We can have a weekly broadcast, it could be sweet.</p>\n\n<p>joey</p>",

The next step was to configure the correct (but secure) port forwarding on the router to forward all incoming traffic to the maverick server.

                "content": "<p>Everything at this point seems to be jiving. As my first experience with configuring a server and my one millionth with ssh, needless to say I was a bit frustrated. Getting ssh to work on a server should be a snap. I think ultimately I kept getting confused with the ssh client and the ssh daemon. I don&rsquo;t think the Pabst helped at all, but at least I was feeling good. Regardless, I got the <a href=\"http://labs.joef.org/?page_id=5\">server</a> now running ssh and can log into it within my network.  If worst comes to worse I can also sftp into  it and pull some files from it.</p>\n\n<p>I also got apache installed and can view post 80 with the ip address. I guess my next step is to configure the domain name and we should be in business. That sounds easy, but I tend to be a complete reject when it comes to dns, so we&rsquo;ll see.

Who knows.</p>\n\n<p>In other news, I got the latest version of <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">ubuntu</a> installed on the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joefearnley/91270515/\">mac mini</a>. Seeing as I was having a hard time with the OSX interface, and as how I seem to take a liking to the <a href=\"http://gnome.org\">gnome</a> one, I thought it would be perfect to try it out and see what happens. After first trying a <a href=\"http://gentoo.org\">gentoo</a> install and a kernel compilation error, <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">ubuntu</a> was a no brainer. The installation was like butter, up and running in no time. The only problem I encountered was the wireless networking (apparently the cards info was not released to the open source community so some dude had to reverse engineer it). So if anyone has questions about getting the airport extreme card woking with <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">ubuntu</a>, let me know. I now have my sites set on the <a href=\"http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/imic/\">iMic</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For the future of this site, I am seeing a *beer of the month* section.  Yes, thats right, beer of the month. But this wont be anything that will make me look sophisticated, it will be more like the never-ending variaties of malt liquor. All in all, this enhancement will bring the version of my site out of beta. Sweet.</p>\n\n<p>joe</p>",

I was thinking its time to sell this thing….I have debts to pay off and as honestly, I can only use one computer at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Then a couple of things happened. First of all, the linux box is gone. Wasnt preparing for that one. I just got the wireless card working and was ready to begin configuring the best gentoo system ever. I tell you what, you tried to be nice and …. anyway. So then I read this article about how you can use your mac mini as a pre-production studio with a <a href=\"http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/imic2/\">$40 piece of hardware</a>. I got to thinking about how I dont play my guitar that much anymore and how fun it was to be in a band. So, I took the mini downstairs, made a purchase from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">amazon</a>, set up a workspace, and now I am making music.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I have only played with it a couple of time. I recorded one guitar part with <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/\">GarageBand</a> built-in modern rock guitar effect and it didnt sound too bad. I will update the progress, if I acheive any.</p>\n\n<p>joe</p>",

I truely want to say that I like it, but it certainly is taking some getting used to. I suppose I am not saying that I dont like it, but the interface is a bit different and this single-button mouse world is putting up its dukes up to my double-button mouse world, that for sure. If worse comes to worse, I can always revert, inputs are quite compatable.</p>\n\t<p>I do like the unix-like terminal and installing “amp” was a snap.
