                                    <h1>Check database results using Eloquent's whereRaw</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the Laravel Framework lately. Laravel ships with the Eloquent ORM. In the application I am creating I need a way to do a simple search on a text column in a database. The easiest way to do this in MySQL is to taken in the keyword from the form and use the LIKE keyword on that column. </p>

<p>Im my case, I am taking a single text input and searching the name column in a table. I have a function that takes input from a form, creates a search parameter and executes the query:</p>

<pre>
$parameters = [$searchInput];
$whereClause = 'upper(name) like upper(?)';
$results = Table::whereRaw($whereClause, $parameters)-&gt;get();
</pre>

<p>This is fine, but what if the query returns no results? I don&rsquo;t know if my Google foo is getting dated, but for the life of me I could not find a good way to perform this check. Doing the following with no match on the database column:</p>

<pre>
$whereClause = 'upper(name) like upper(?)';
$results = Table::whereRaw($whereClause, $parameters)-&gt;get();
var_dump($results);
</pre>

<p>returns the following results:</p>

<pre>
object(Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection)#191 (1) {
  ["items":protected]=&gt;
  array(0) {
  }
}
</pre>

<p>My first thought would be to check the items attribute. It is a protected attribute so I can&rsquo;t access it directly (at least from here) or create a getItems() function on the Table class. The latter didn&rsquo;t seem to work either. That or maybe I wasn&rsquo;t doing it right. </p>

<p>Regardless, I found a solution. If I convert the results to an array (or json as the other option) I could then check if it is empty doing the following:</p>

<pre>
$whereClause = 'upper(name) like upper(?)';
$results = Table::whereRaw($whereClause , 
                                $parameters)-&gt;get()-&gt;toArray();
  
if(!empty($results)) {
  // results were found
} else {
  // no results....
}
</pre>

<p>There may be an easier way to do this and calling toArray() may cause some extra processing on the application&rsquo;s part but it works. Maybe there will be time to refactor later. Another cool part of this is now I have a simple array to work with making life a little easier in this case.</p>
